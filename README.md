# primitive-monitor
Bash script monitor that prints output of: date, uptime, free -m and df -h

<h3><strong>There is a bug, that breaks the output. To run script properly, please clear the terminal first.</strong></h3>

TODO:
  - fix bug that breaks the monitor when output isn't printed on whole terminal window
  - add more resources to monitor
  - make it pretty
